# Project: GYM app deployed in AWS

Welcome to the GYM app, this project/app was created with the purpose to put in practice various topics related to Data science, Web Development, Cloud (I used AWS for the infrastructure) and Data engineering.

I wanted to create and application so I can get a better understanding of how thing really work. Personally, I do not like to just copy and paste from tutorials (YT/Udemy/ You name it!) and at least for me I do not feel that I am learning something, so I just decided to migrate my learning to project-based learning.

## A quick presentation:

So let's pretend for a sec that you are a either a consultant or you are an employee in the largest Gym chain in your City/Country. The Gym ops team has created/sourced a dataset that is related to gym exercises (gym_exercise_dataset.csv, thanks Kaggle) but it is sitting there, alone, in a NAS drive somewhere of this big corpo. Tom Tom, which is a Senior executive, sees the potential of this small dataset that was sourced a time ago to help create a more "Data-Driven Corporation" (His words, not mine, I am just a scribbler), so he has tasked you to at least create an app so he can present the results to higher manager... And here is where our little project begins.   



## My plan:

For the moment, I have the following plan for this exercise:

1. Analyze the data - Understand in detail how we can use the data and what are its characteristics --> For this I used matplotlib and pandas and other non-technical skills.
2. Develope an Angular Application - At the beginning I am going to start small, just a simple dashboard application, with pie charts, etc.
3. Create the Infrastructure in AWS - I am going to use AWS to create the infrastructure: Such as RDS, Lambda, S3 and the such to have a better "Playground" to model my exercise.
    3.1 I am going to create an ETL job, so I can add a little more difficulty to this exercise.
4. Deploy the app - I am not going to Market it or something, just wanted to have the first hand experience of deploying an app
